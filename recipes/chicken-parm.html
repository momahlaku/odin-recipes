        <p><em>Chicken-Parmesan</em></p>
    
        <p> My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.</p>

            <p><strong>Ingridients</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>

                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    
                <li> 1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed </li>
                    
                <li> ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                    
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
                    
                <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        
                <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
                <li> ¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li> ¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
                <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese </li>
                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil </li>
               
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
                    <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p> </li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>
                    <p>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.</p> 
                        <p>Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch..</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
                    <p>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>
                    <p>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>
                    <p>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>
                    <p>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides.</p>
                    <p>Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong>
                    <p>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer</p>
                    <p>Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 8:</strong>
                   <p>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.</p> 
                   <p>Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 9:</strong>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
                    <p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
                
              
            </ol>
